        "**1. XGBoost: The Precision Leader**\n",
        "Analysis: With an MAE of 3.06, this model is highly effective for daily inventory planning. On average, it only misses the actual demand by ~3 units.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:** The low RMSE (6.71) indicates it handles sales spikes well, and the near-zero Bias (0.34) means it isn't systematically over or under-predicting.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it won: XGBoost’s ability to use \"lags\" and \"rolling means\" directly allowed it to memorize the specific day-to-day patterns of the Guayas stores.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. LSTM: The Under-Forecaster**\n",
        "Analysis: The LSTM performed well (MAE 7.02) but was twice as \"wrong\" as XGBoost.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:** The Negative Bias (-0.70) is the key takeaway. A negative bias means the model tends to under-forecast. In a real retail environment, this would lead to \"stock-outs\" (empty shelves) because the model consistently predicts less than what customers actually buy.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Prophet: The Strategic \"Fail\"**\n",
        "Analysis: An MAE of 74.57 and a Bias of 73.87 indicate a major forecasting failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Interpretation:** Because the MAE is almost equal to the Bias, the model is consistently over-forecasting by ~74 units every single day.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why it failed: Prophet is designed for \"macro\" trends. For this specific Guayas dataset, it likely mistook a small holiday increase for a massive, permanent upward trend, leading to highly inflated predictions."

        "\n",
        "**For the Store Manager:** Use XGBoost for daily ordering. It is the most accurate and minimizes the risk of both waste (over-stocking) and empty shelves (under-stocking).\n",
        "\n",
        "**For the Supply Chain Executive:**  Be cautious with Prophet. While its \"Component Plots\" are excellent for visualizing holiday impacts, the current results show it is too optimistic (High Positive Bias) and could lead to financial loss through over-stocking.\n",
        "\n",
        "**For the Data Science Team:**The LSTM shows promise. With more training time or different scaling, it could potentially catch up to XGBoost, but it requires significantly more computational power."
